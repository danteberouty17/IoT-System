1. Moisture Measurement for Fridges
Sensor Name: Moisture Meter (from Dataniz)

2. Water Consumption Measurement for Dishwasher
Sensor Name: YF-S201 Water Flow Sensor
    • Type of Sensor: Digital (Pulse output)
    • Description: Utilizes a turbine wheel and a Hall effect sensor to measure water flow rate. It outputs pulses proportional to the flow rate, which can be integrated over time to calculate total water consumption.
    • Sensor Range:
        ◦ Flow Rate: 1 to 30 Liters per Minute (L/min)
    • Desired Value:
        ◦ Minimum: 0 L/min
        ◦ Maximum: 10 L/min
    • Unit of Measurement: Liters per Minute (L/min) for flow rate; Liters (L) for total consumption

3. Electricity Consumption Measurement for Fridges and Dishwasher
Sensor Name: PZEM-004T AC Power Meter Module
    • Type of Sensor: Digital (Serial communication)
    • Description: Measures AC voltage, current, power, and energy consumption. Suitable for monitoring household appliances and communicates via a serial interface for easy data retrieval.
    • Sensor Range:
        ◦ Energy: 0kWh to 9999kWh
    • Desired Value:
        ◦ Minimum: 0 kWh (before operation)
        ◦ Maximum: 2 kWh per wash cycle
    • Unit of Measurement: Kilowatt-hours (kWh)
